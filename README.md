Sky trajectories of fixed celestial coordinates.  View [here](http://www.tonyyli.com/viz/skypaths/index.html).

# Instructions

- Specify the RA/Dec (J2000) of the point on the sky you want to track.
- Specify the latitude/longitude of the location you're observing from.


# Notes

- The current location (assuming accurate latitude and longitude) and trajectory of your target - will be shown on the plot below.
- Dark blue represents the approximate nighttime trajectory (6pm-6am). Light blue represents the daytime trajectory (6am-6pm).
- The center maps to the zenith, while the black circle maps to the horizon.
- North and south poles are shown as small white circles.
- Atmospheric refraction is not currently considered.

DISCLAIMER: Much of the original code came from [this d3 visualization](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/7784f4b2c7838b893e9b) by Mike Bostock.  I have merely modified it for my purposes here.
